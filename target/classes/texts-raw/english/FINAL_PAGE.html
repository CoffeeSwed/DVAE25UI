<h1>How Local Differential Privacy is used to maintain a level of privacy</h1>
<br><b>Important!</b><br>
When you finish your survey, Local Differential Privacy is applied to your answers before being sent to us to maintain a certain level of privacy.<br><br>The answers you have given will be <b>published publicly</b> after Differential Privacy processes has been applied to them. Local Differential Privacy is utilized by adding “noise” to your answers before its sent to us, introducing a degree of deniability and uncertainty that you participated in the study and what your true answers were. <br><br>Noise is introduced by changing your answers before sending the form to us by a random probability. The probability of an answer being changed is high enough to provide a degree of privacy and low enough for the survey to provide meaningful scientific results when summarizing the processed answers.
<br><br>
<b>Only the answers with noise in them are published publicly, and they are not linked to you but instead a randomly generated identification code.</b>
